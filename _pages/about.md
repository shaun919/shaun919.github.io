I'm a graduate student from [School of Biomedical Engineering](https://portal.smu.edu.cn/swyxgcxy/index.htm), [Southern Medical University](http://www.smu.edu.cn/). 

I focus on medical image processing, with a broad range of research interests spanning deep learning and artificial intelligence. And I will continue my graduate studies 
this fall.


You can find my CV here: [Fu Yingji's Curriculum Vitae](../files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
